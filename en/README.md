# Writing

## George Orwell:

	- A scrupulous writer, in every sentence that he writes, will ask himself at least four questions, thus:
	    1. What am I trying to say?
	    2. What words will express it?
	    3. What image or idiom will make it clearer?
	    4. Is this image fresh enough to have an effect?

	- And he will probably ask himself two more:
	    5. Could I put it more shortly?
	    6. Have I said anything that is avoidably ugly?

	- One can often be in doubt about the effect of a word or a phrase, and one needs rules that one can rely 
	   on when instinct fails. I think the following rules will cover most cases:
	    1. Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.
	    2. Never use a long word where a short one will do.
	    3. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
	    4. Never use the passive where you can use the active.
	    5. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word.
	    6. Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.

## Cubing
	- "Cubing" means looking at a topic from six different perspectives, like the six sides of a cube. 
	- First, choose your topic and write it at the top of your page to help you remember it. 
	- Next, take 5 minutes to write about your topic from six different perspectives 
	- again, think of the sides of the cube. 
	- You may not be able to do all six, but do the best you can.
	
## Wordiness?
	Another problem in writing is wordiness. Wordiness happens when you use more words than you need to 
	in order to write what you mean. Everyone has a tendency to be too wordy at times. 
	Some of the causes of this wordiness are:
		- Trying to sound too formal or academic. Readers always appreciate clear ideas in less words
		- Not knowing more precise vocabulary.
		- Using unnecessary and vague modifiers. Modifiers are: really, very, quite.
		- Using too many unnecessarily prepositional phrases or possessives.
		
	Some steps to take to reduce wordiness when reviewing your work:
		- Look for any of the phrases from this table and write them more succinctly.
		- Look for modifiers. Find precise single-word that expresses the same meaning as word + modifier.
		- Cut lengthy sentence.
		- Read sentences loud, one by one.
		- Don't use a passive verb construction when active would be better. 
		- Eliminate unnecessary personal commentary i.e. I believe, I think, I just want to emphasize etc.

## Writing : 
	
	- Write outline: It's good to create a plan for writing.
		- Write your introduction and it draw your reader in
		- Make your topic clear. 
		- Make it interesting
		
	- Craft paragraphs: 
		- Each paragraph should focus on a main idea.
		
	- End with conclusion.
	- How, when, and what to revise
	- Checking writing for logical order
	- Reading backwards
	
	- Language Guidelines:
		- Use active verbs and write actively.
		- Use present and future verb tenses correctly
		- use strong verb
		- Include a variety of sentence types: simple, compound and complex with these words:
			- the conjunctions and, but, or,so
			- transition words therefore, however, as a result;
			- time words before, after, as soon as, while
			- contrast and condition words although, if
			- relative pronouns who, which, that, where, when (ADJ clauses)
			- question words how, where, when, what (NOUN clauses)

## Article 

### A/AN
	- If "one"/"any" would make sense in front of the noun, use “a.” 
        	Example: I saw one man and one woman walk by == I saw a man and a woman walk by. 
        	(they are random people; I don’t know who they are)
	- “A” is for one of many.
	- With names of jobs/nationalities and religions/a day of the week/unknown to listener  
   
### THE
	- If “that” would make sense in front of the noun, use “the.” 
        	Example: I put that book in your room. == I put the book in your room.
	- “The” is for the only one, or the one in my mind.

    
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Punctuation

### Comma
	- join two independent clauses with comma and conjunction 	
            	Example: Sam washed his face, and he combed his hair.
            
	- join two independent clauses with semicolon & comma and transaction word 
           	 Example: Sam washed his face; therefore, he combed his hair.
            
	- use in series of words 									
            	Example: the dog chases rabbit, cats, and birds.
            
	- use after introductory phrases 							
            	Example: due to bad weather, our was cancelled.
            
	- use before and after interrupting phrases 				
            	Example: this is the reason, therefore, that you should buy a house.
            
	- Use a comma after a dependent clause that starts 			
            	Example: When I went running, I saw a duck
            
	- Use a comma after introductory adverbs.					
            	Example: Finally, I went running.
       
### semicolon: avoid too much of use
	- Join two compound sentence
		Example: I have painted the house; I still need to sand the floors.
		
	- It is used to connect independent clauses.
		Example: John was hurt; he knew she only said it to upset him.

### Colon

	It has three main uses. 
	- The first is after a word introducing a quotation, an explanation, an example, or a series :
		Example: He was planning to study four subjects: politics, philosophy, sociology and economics.

	- The second is between independent clauses, when the second explains the first, similar to a semicolon:
		Example: I didn't have time to get changed: I was already late.

	- The third use of a colon is for emphasis:
		Example: There was one thing she loved more that any other: her dog.
	
	- Use for list of items and sentence should be complete (independent clause)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Preposition

### On
	- apply when it refers to open space 
		Example: on horse/bus/aeroplane/ship/
	
### in 
	- apply when it refers to closed/narrow space 
		Example: in car/van/rocket

### AT ON IN
	- (AT - ON - IN) < - - > (Hour - Day - Year)
		- at 2 o' clock /at 5PM / at noon
		- on Tuesday / on my birthday / on 8th Aug
		- in four weeks / in June/ 
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Transition Words

	- introduce information:
		Also, Indeed, Further, Furthermore, Likewise, In particular, What's more, In addition, Similarly
	
	- conflicts/dismissals/emphasis: 
		But, However, Nevertheless, Nonetheless, Regardless, 
	
	- relationship of cause and effect or consequence: 
		As, But, For, Since, Otherwise, Consequently, Unless, Thus, Therefore
		(first statement lead to or cause the other statement)
	
	- chronological sequences in time or provide a sequence to a logical argument: 
		Afterwards, Therefore, To begin with

## Sample structure

    - "Since" I am collecting the data for modelling for PL I wanted to understand. 
    - Since at some point of time we will also redevelop another, it will make sense to collect the data for both. 
    - PL is a "comparatively" high default portfolio with a long-run ODR of ~23%. 
    - "We therefore", used 2013-2017 period to construct the segmentation.
    - You can "prioritize the X1 data over X2"
    - The data have been validated for this exercise and all findings are documented along with data sanity checks.
    - To comply with roadmap for growth, we are rebuilding models and attempting to fulfil requirements stated in.
    - How can we obtain data from 2020
    - Not sure you had the opportunity to reflect on my data request for model re-development.
    - I am looking to start the development of PL and wanted to obtain from you the existing model details.
    - As you are aware, the redevelopment of model is already in progress.
